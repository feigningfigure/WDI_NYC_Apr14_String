## FINAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION

You've worked by yourself, collaborated with each other on labs and homeworks, we've pair programmed, we've worked in groups to explore a more realistic scenario of on-the-job experience.  For your final project, it's all up to you.  As always, the type of app you create is your choice: utility, social network, game, mashup, data visualization, etc. but be sure the scope is not too large so you can reasonably complete an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) by the deadline.  

The objective of this project is to:

* Create a project from the ground up.
* Be organized and demonstrate clear thought.
* Write beautiful code
	* Cleanly and consitently formatted
	* Clearly thought out
* Pay attention to user experience
* Practice integrating topics covered during this entire course.
* Create a **PORTFOLIO READY** project!

You can work alone or in groups no larger than 2 for this final project. Show us what you can do!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Hosted.** Strongly consider using your Digital Ocean and DNSimple credit to host your work.  Heroku is a must.
* **Rails + (Backbone )**  Take advantage of Rails and Backbone. 
* **Handles Invalid Data.** Forms in your application should validate data on both the client-side with JavaScript and again on the back-end with rails.  Use regular expressions!  Ensure the user has entered the correct data types, string lengths, formats, etc.
* **Tested** Use tests as you are developing your app.  Pick your core logic elements.  Tests verify they are still functioning properly.

## PROJECT PLANNING

####Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features may you implement given the time period?
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work and link between each other. 
* **Milestones.** We will give you some dates and milestones to help keep you on track. Outline some specific milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work, as they fit into our class milestones.

**Start your readme now!  Include all the above project plan items**

####Completed Project deliverables:
* Link to hosted project URL
* Link to source code on GitHub
* Completed project `README.md`


## TIMELINE

In the morning when you walk into class:

* Thursday - Project plan deliverables due including a project backlog
* Friday - Data model complete and hosted on Heroku; Project should also be hosted in a new repository under your own account on GitHub.
	* **Name of project established**
* Monday - Core functionality nearing completion (back-end rails stuff, api connectivity established and functional, etc.), front-end underway
* Tuesday - Core functionality 100% complete, working on UX enhancements.
* Wednesday - Site is at MVP, working on styling/polish, working on cleaning up your code
* Thursday - Completed project deliverables due.  Prepare presentation and succinct explanation of project, concepts, and defense of decisions.

End of the week:

* Thursday day - In-class demos and Science Fair
* Thursday night - Retrospective.  What worked well?  Where could my project be improved?  How could my process be improved?


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code and files are:

* In the proper places. Any business logic in views? Fat controllers?
* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Well-formatted. Write pretty code: indent properly, format consistently.
* Adheres to the code formatting styles we've been presenting in class.

Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.

###And most importantly...
**Work on something you** ***like*** and
#Have fun!
