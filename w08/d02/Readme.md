## Morning Exercise


### Group Collab


#### Part 1 

***GOAL***: To build a fully functional CRUD application with your group.

- You will each be building part of the application.
- Choose a single model and decide together what attributes the model will have (keep it simple!).  For example: 
	Model - Car
	Attributes - Year, Make, Model, Color, etc.
		
- You will have a short Scrum to decide who will be responsible for each piece. The idea is NOT to pair program, but to split up responsibilities and work independently.

***To begin, 1 person drives***

- Since the goal is to build the application together, how can we collaborate on our code?
- To begin:
 
	- 1 Person Drives, with Entire Group Collaboration:
		- Create a new a repo on Github.   
		- Create a new rails project (in your personal or projects folder).
		- Create a controller, a views folder and a migration file.
		- In the controller, write out blank methods for each of the CRUD operations.  
		- Hook up the new rails project to Github and push it up.
		- Add your partners as collaborators on the project.  This will allow all of you to push and pull code from that repo.
	- Everyone:
		- Clone the repo into your personal or projects folder

#### Part 2

- ***SCRUM TIME!***
	- Split up responsibilities in a logical way.  Consider assigning one entire CRUD function to each person, i.e., one person creates the controller action and view for `create` while someone else creates the controller action and view for `update`, etc.
		
#### Part 3

- Move AWAY from the rest of your team.  No one should be sitting close to each other. 
- You will each work independently.  ***The only way you are allowed to communicate is via private message on HipChat***
	- Do NOT use any form of group communcation 
	
	
***Notes***:
	- Use rails form helpers.       
	- Consider using partials, they might make this a lot easier.
