  graduated last year with my degree in international business, since then I've worked in a marketing for crowdsourced advertising agency and telecommunications company, I've always had a passion for innovation and entrepreneurship, so i'm hoping to move closer towards that within both an industry and functional capacity. 


  I think that positive change or innovation really does come from the ground up and I'd like to get involved in the venture backed startup culture in both an industry and functional capacity.
