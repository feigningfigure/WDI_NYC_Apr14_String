## Morning Exercise

### JQuery Show-Hide Exercise Redux

This morning, we're refactoring and improving the funcitonality of the jquery exercise we did on w07 d02.  This time, we want to be able to:

- hide and show individual divs
- create divs with identical code
	We want to do this so that we can use this code with dynamically generated content.

This time, you will use the following JQuery methods:

	.show
	.hide
	.prev
	.next
	.slideToggle

I have written the HTML and CSS for you. There is only 1 CSS call involved in this method (display: none).  Otherwise, this is pure JQuery.

###Moody Person Object - Practice with JS Objects
- Create an array of 5 person objects
	- A person should have attributes including name, age, and mood
	- A person should be able to `introduce` itself
		- This introduction should reflect their mood
		- For example:
			- If the person is happy, their introduction may be
				- 'Hi!  I am Bob!  Pleased to meet you!'
			- If the person is unhappy, their introduction may be
				- 'hi...  Bob here...'
	- Note: How to implement mood is your decision.  It could be strings like 'happy' or 'unhappy' or it also could be a range of 0 to 10, where 10 is best mood ever and 0 is worst mood ever.  Your choice here.
