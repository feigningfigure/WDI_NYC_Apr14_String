## Morning Exercise

### JQuery Show-Hide Exercise Redux

This morning, we're refactoring and improving the funcitonality of the jquery exercise we did on w07 d02.  This time, we want to be able to:

- hide and show individual divs
- create divs with identical code
	We want to do this so that we can use this code with dynamically generated content.

This time, you will use the following JQuery methods:

	.show
	.hide
	.prev
	.next
	.slideToggle

I have written the HTML and CSS for you. There is only 1 CSS call involved in this method (display: none).  Otherwise, this is pure JQuery.
