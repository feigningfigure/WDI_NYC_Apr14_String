## Morning Exercise 

### Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?

- Create a rails application called `cookie_jar`

- Create a `CookieWatcher` model
- name : string
- cookies : int

- A get request to `/` should show the lyrics:
- [accuser's name]: "Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar? [thief's name] stole the cookie from the cookie jar."
- [thief's name]: "Who, me?"
- [accuser's name]: "Yes, you!"
- [thief's name]: "Not me! Couldn't be! Wasn't me!"
- [accuser's name]: "Then who?"

- When someone is chosen as a thief, their `cookies` should be incremented because they clearly stole the cookie


**Seed the table with these names**
