###More Relationships

####Part 1 
- Continue what you had started during yesterday's homework and finish it

####Part 2
- Considering the models you made yesterday, add a third model to your application
	- This new model should have a `many-to-many` relationship with one of your other models. 
	- Create a new database table for this model
- Create a new named joiner table (choose a logical name) to implement the relationship of the new model to the original model(s)
- **Check in Rails console to ensure that the joiner table is working**
- Modify your seed file to account for the new model and relationship
- Create the appropriate controllers actions, routes, and views so that a user can **Create** using the new model


**NOTE** - Refer to today's in class cookbook example for guidance.
