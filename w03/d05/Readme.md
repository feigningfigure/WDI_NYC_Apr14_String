## Morning Exercise:
### Superhero Extending

#### Create reusable code that can be applied to multiple classes

### Your user stories:

* Define a Human class. It should have attributes like name, age and gender. It should include a `speak` method that says something like:  ""Hi.  I'm so-and-so, a [some number]-year-old [gender]."

* Using Faker, create 5 instances of Humans with random names, ages and genders.

* Define a Dog class.  It should have attributes like name and owner. It should include a `speak` method appropriate to a dog.


#### Bonus

* Define a Superhero module with methods like `fly` and `save_people`.
