## Morning Exercise: Fakers!

You are bursting with newly gained superpowers in gem wrangling, object domination and array display.  

In fact, you're feeling so good about yourself, just one nemesis is not enough.

This is what you want to do...


### Build

- Create a Person class that initializes Faker (Faker::Name.name) as name

- Include a to_s method that says, "Hi! My name is *name*." (This is not code - you have to rewrite this for your method.)

- Build an array of 100 Person objects.

- Print out all 100 names (this is your list of enemies).

**NOTE:** When you run your program, you will get this error message before your output:

"[deprecated] I18n.enforce_available_locales will default to true in the future. If you really want to skip validation of your locale you can set I18n.enforce_available_locales = false to avoid this message."

This is just due to the new security aspects of Rails 4.  Don't worry about it.


### Hints

- Don't remember how to install a gem? See https://rubygems.org/gems/faker

- Remember to call your gem at the top of your file, e.g.: require 'Faker'

- Want to know more about Faker? See http://faker.rubyforge.org/


### Bonus Superpowers

- build your array 2 different ways
- use syntatic sugar on each way

(Comment out the extra builds, of course)
