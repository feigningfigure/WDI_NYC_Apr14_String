###PseudoCode Activity: Closet-Organization Machine
Make a machine that organizes a pile of clothes on your bed and then determines which shelf in your closet to put it on based on color.

####Things to know:

- Top Shelf can include only Green Shirts
- Middle Shelf can include only Blue Shirts
- Bottom Shelf can include only pants.

- Core Library of Objects: Let's imagine that the machine has a few core objects:

		Scanner
		Mover

These two components or "objects" receive messages and are capable of various procedures and operations. For example, the mover can move things from one place to another and the scanner can scan other objects and return data about their attributes. For example, it could scan a shirt object and tell you its color. 

NOTE: You may need to add more objects to complete this assignment.
