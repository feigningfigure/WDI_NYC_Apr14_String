# a machine to sort clothes in a rather OCD manner
# why does someone this OCD have a pile of clothes on the bed anyway?

# we need to scan the clothes on the bed
# we need to set up boolean values to sort items found to the shelves
# we need to move the items appropriately

# values for shelves are: 
# 1. Item color (blue, green)
# 2. Item type (shirts, pants)

# using "mover" instead of "push" to add items to empty arrays??

load './bed' #a hash of keys and values (clothing_item: type, color)

class Item
	def initialize(color, type)
		@color = color
		@type = type
	end
end

def scanner()
	@color = item.color?
	@type = item.type?
end

def closet.scanner(x)  					# can the hash file be the passed argument? this way we can sort clothes in other places too!
closet = [[shelf_top], [shelf_middle], [shelf_bottom]] # defining the closet as part of the method
shelf_top = []
shelf_middle = []
shelf_bottom = []
x.Open									# need to open the bed file?
x.each if @color: green == true && @type: shirt == true
	mover.shelf_top						# puts moves items to appropriate array/ shelf?
elsif @color: blue == true && @type: shirt == true
	mover.shelf_middle
elsif @type: pants == true
	mover.shelf_bottom
else
	mover.floor
end
closet = closet.each do {|i| puts i}	# trying to print itemized closet, i know it's trickier to print a multidimensional arrays than this tho
puts "Here's your #{closet}"
end

closet.scanner(bed)
