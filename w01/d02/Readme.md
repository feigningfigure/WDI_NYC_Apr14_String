## Morning Exercise

###Your Closet

- Create a file structure for the organization of clothes in a dresser
- You must organize your clothes by type and color, with each category in a separate drawer
- Represent clothes as "http://filename.md," e.g. "http://blacksocks1.md""

Your clothes include:

- 2 red t-shirts
- 3 long-sleeved shirts (1 green, 1 blue, 1 red)
- 3 pairs of black socks
- 2 pairs of Batman  socks
- 1 pair of white socks


#### Hints

- Navigate to Desktop
- Create a directory called "dresser" or "dresser1" (which would be better and why?)
- Create directories for the different drawers
- Try creating multiple directories/files at one time by using a space between each directory/folder <noframes></noframes>

##Part 1
- Finish the below conditionals that were started in class:

###Drinking age?
- Define a function that takes an age as an argument.
- If the age is less than 21, print an appropriate message. 
- If the age is over 21, print an appropriate message.


###Air Conditioning
- Define a function that takes, as arguments, the current temperature, whether or not the A/C is functional, and a desired temperature.
    -If the air conditioner is functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Turn on the A/C Please"
    -If the air conditioner is non-functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Fix the A/C now!  It's hot!"
    -If the air conditioner is non-functional and the current temperature is below the the desired temperature... display "Fix the A/C whenever you have the chance...  It's cool...Brrrrrrr."

##Part 2

###Guess the number:
- You are to generate a basic "guess my number" game.  The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10.  The user will guess the number until they guess correctly.

###Specification:
- The user should be asked to guess a number
- If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
- If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again.
- This should be done in a new file called guess_the_number.rb

##Part 3

###Calculator:
-You will be building a calculator.  A calculator can perform multiple arithmetic operations.  Your function should allow the user to choose which operation is expected, enter in the values to perform the operation on, and ultimately view the result.

###Specification:
- A user should be given a menu of operations
- A user should be able to choose from the menu
- A user should be able to enter two numbers on which to perform the operations
- A user should be shown the result
- This process should continue until the user selects a quit option from the menu

#####Phase 1
- Calculator functionality
	- Calculator should be able to do basic arithmetic (+,-, *, /)

#####Phase 2
- Advanced Calculator functionality
	- Calculator should be able to do basic arithmetic (exponents, square roots)

#####Bonus
######Back-end
- Make it such that you can perform continuous operations (i.e. 4 X 10 / 2 + 6 - 1)

##Starter Code:

```
def get_user_choice

end

def add(num1,num2)

end

def subtract(num1,num2)

end

def divide(num1,num2)

end

def multiply(num1,num2)

end
```
