### Anagram Detector


***"Anagram": the rearranging of the letters of a word to produce a new word ***


Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct one(s).

In other words, given: `"listen"` and `%w(enlists google inlets banana)` the program should return "inlets". (Look up "%w" if you don't know what it does.)

Think about: 

- What are the scenarios we should test for to see if a word is an anagram?
- What makes something an anagram? The two words have the same letters...
- How can we check to see if they have exactly the same letters?
