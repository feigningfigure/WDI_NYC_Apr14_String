    <h2>Background </h2>
    <p>My name is Nelson Schubart. I grew up in a small town in New Hampshire but have also been lucky to have called Boston, London, San Francisco, and now, New York home.  Since graduating from Tufts University where I studied Economics and Entreprenuership, I have worked as a Financial Analyst for an investment bank in San Francisco and most recently as a Research Analyst for a hedge fund here in New York. I am now switching focus to entreprenuerial ventures and look forward to the GA WDI course helping me execute on this dream! In my spare time I enjoy running, golfing, snowboarding, and am an avid sports fan (Gmen!).</p>
