## Morning Exercise: ATM (1960s-style)


### Build

Build the following:

**- Client Object**
	- Name your file `client.rb`
	- Client should have a name
	- Client should have a $ balance
	- Client should have a to_s method, along the lines of: 
	  "Welcome so-and-so. Your balance is such-and-such."

**- ATM Object** 
	- Name your file `atm.rb`
	- ATM should have a $ balance
	- ATM should allow the client to make deposits and withdrawal
		- both methods should perform the exchange between the client's account and ATM balance
	-  ATM should have a to_s method, along the lines of: "Your new balance is: $something"


### Cash Bonus*

**- Transaction Machine**
	- use the file `accounts.rb` for your "bank"
	- ask the client to enter his or her name
	- welcome the client and provide his or her current balance
	- allow the client to deposit money
	- allow the client to withdraw money
	- although we can't save the transaction for future sessions, allow the client's balance 
	  to be altered across any number of deposits and withdrawals within one session 
	  (these clients just like using the machine)

* Well, not really
