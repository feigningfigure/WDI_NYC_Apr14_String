##Morning Exercise

###Part 1

- Make a hash of names
	- The key should be their initials as a symbol
      e.g., :np for Neel Patel

      e.g., ['Neel', 'Patel']

ALL of these names should be in your hash:

spring_wdi = ["Joe Park", "Artem Murga", "John Randall", "Wilson Chan", "Nelson Schubart", "Christopher Bajorin", "Christopher Lee", "Ben Ticsay", "Joel Rosenblatt", "Declan Van Welie", "Andrew Wallace", "Emmanuel Tucker", "Nancy Ko", "Dara Mao", "Jonathan Milgrom", "Liz Goldstein", "Jane Shin", "Victor Rodriguez", "David Montricher", "Kyle Sweet", "Keyan Bagheri", "Mason Tang", "Sophie Laffont", "Zack Levine"]
