## Magic 8 Ball


### Build

Make a Magic 8 Ball using Sinatra!

Your game will:
	- Accept a question from the user.
	- Return the question as well as a randomly selected answer from 
	  the array provided below.

```
["It is certain", "It is decidedly so", "Without a doubt", "Yes definitely", "You may rely on it", "As I see it yes", "Most likely", "Outlook good", "Yes", "Signs point to yes", "Reply hazy try again", "Ask again later", "Better not tell you now", "Cannot predict now", "Concentrate and ask again", "Don't count on it", "My reply is no", "My sources say no", "Outlook not so good", "Very doubtful"]
```


#### Bonus 

- include a "Submit" button
- make your pages well styled; include an image

##Morning Exercise 

###Part 1

-  Create an array of developer objects

-  A developer: 
	- Should have a first name 
	- Should have a last name 
	- Should have a randomly assigned favorite programming language
	- Should have a to_s method that prints something like:
		"My name is David Montricher and I love to program in Klingon."
	
- The below arrays may come in handy:

spring_wdi = ["Joe Park", "Artem Murga", "John Randall", "Wilson Chan", "Nelson Schubart", "Christopher Bajorin", "Christopher Lee", "Ben Ticsay", "Joel Rosenblatt", "Declan Van Welie", "Andrew Wallace", "Emmanuel Tucker", "Nancy Ko", "Dara Mao", "Jonathan Milgrom", "Liz Goldstein", "Jane Shin", "Victor Rodriguez", "David Montricher", "Kyle Sweet", "Keyan Bagheri", "Mason Tang", "Sophie Laffont", "Zack Levine"]

languages = ["Ruby", "Javascript", "C++", "Python", "Fortran", "Java", "Klingon"]


###Part 2
- Write a basic Sinatra application
- A GET request to '/' should display the string "Good morning"
- A GET request to '/*SOME PLACE*' should display the string "Welcome to *SOME PLACE*"
