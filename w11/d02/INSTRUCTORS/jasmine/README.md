# Jasmine

Jasmine is RSpec for Javascript.


## Exercise 1: Getting to "Hello, World!"

**Timeframe**: ~1 hour

1. First we need to decide what it means to get to "Hello, World!" for this
   situation. Will we be running a command line app, or loading a page in
   our browser? Would either way work?

2. [Go!](http://jasmine.github.io/)

3. Once you have a single spec running, try including Backbone and testing the
   behavior of a Backbone model.


## Exercise 2: Integrating with Rails

**Timeframe**: ~1.5 hours

1. Explore your options.

   - Is there a gem?
   - What is the gem doing?
   - What would be involved in setting things up without the gem?

2. Make a new empty Rails project where you can play with the gem

3. Make a new empty Rails project where you can try integrating Jasmine,
   Backbone, and Rails yourself.

4. Use the penguinpals codebase for sample behavior to test.
