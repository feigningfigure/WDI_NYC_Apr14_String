## SECOND PROJECT DESCRIPTION

You've worked by yourself, collaborated with each other on labs and homeworks, we've pair programmed, and now we get to work in groups to explore a more realistic scenario of on-the-job experience.  For this second project, you now have the power of JavaScript to create richer, more exciting web applications.  The type of app you create is your choice: utility, social network, game, mashup, data visualization, etc. but be **SURE** the scope is not too large so you can reasonably complete an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) by the deadline.

The objective of this project is to:

* Pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
* Gain experience collaborating and working in a development team.
* Practice integrating topics covered during this course thus far, bridging the gaps between the various areas of a web app (front and back-ends).
* Enhance the user experience with the power of browser-side (JavaScript) programming.

You will be working in **groups** for this second project. 

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.


* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models with appropriate associations and validations.
* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your views.  Load data via Ajax when appropriate.
* **Handles Invalid Data.** Forms in your application should validate data on both the client-side with JavaScript and again on the back-end with rails.  Use regular expressions!  Ensure the user has entered the correct data types, string lengths, formats, etc.
* **Use an API.** Use an external API to add functionality to your app.
* **User Login.** Make sure you have a user model with basic authentication and authorization set up. Consider using Sorcery or Devise.
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku with a PostgreSQL database.
* **User Experience with Animations and AJAX.** Ensure a logical, easy to look at, and nice to use experience.  Use subtle fades/animations, and load additional data with ajax to keep the user flow smooth and reduce the number of page loads.


## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period?
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.  Pen and paper is very easy and you can take a picture to save it, or use software like PowerPoint, Keynote, Gliffy (online), and Omnigraffle ($$).
* **Wireframes.** Recall our first day and the "about you" table drawings…  Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work and link between each other. Again, pen and aper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Protoshare or Balsamic.
* **Resources.** Gather the necessary resources and bookmark links to any documentation or references you will be using in your project.  Add them to your documentation in a section called "Resources."
* **Milestones.** We will give you some dates and milestones to help keep you on track. Outline some specific milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work, as they fit into our class milestones.
* **`README.md`** Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project.  Explain your concept and data model.  What problem are you solving?  What gems and/or APIs are you using?
  * This needs a how and why of what you wanted to solve, how they built, problems, tech used.
  * This file should include the elements of your project plan.
  * Add your list of resources, research, and documentation links to this file.
  * If you're including a separate file or folder for your data model, put it in a file or folder called `data_model` with the proper extensions.
  * If you're including a separate file or folder for your wireframes, put it in a file or folder called `wireframe` with the proper extensions.

####Completed Project deliverables:

In addition to your `README.md` file with the project plan in your OWN repository on GitHub, add the following to your folder in the work repository under your name folder for week 9:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub

###Daily Scrum

* What happened yesterday?
* Which user stories are to be completed today?
* Any obstacles/blocks for today's stories?

##Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code and files are:

* In the proper places. Any business logic in views? Fat controllers?
* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Well-formatted. Write pretty code: indent properly, format consistently.
* Adheres to the code formatting styles we've been presenting in class.

We’ll also be looking at:
* User experience. 
* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.


###And most importantly...
**Work on something you** ***like*** and
#Have fun!
