<h1>Welcome to JQuery Fun!</h1>

<p>JQuery may sometimes be frustrating after the ease of Ruby, but once you get the hang of it, you'll dive into all it has to offer.</p>

<p>In this morning exercise you will learn how to target specific elements in your html (such as the paragraph above) and alter their class.  You'll also learn how to apply a new effect: slideToggle.</p>

<div class="teaser">
jQuery makes it trivial to add simple effects to your page. <a class="less-link" id="less-link1" href="#">Less</a>
</div>

<p id="less-text1">Effects can use the built-in settings, or provide a customized duration. You can also create custom animations of arbitrary CSS properties. For complete details on jQuery effects, visit the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/">Effects documentation</a> on api.jquery.com.
</p>

<div class="teaser">
jQuery provides simple methods for attaching event handlers to selections. <a class="less-link" id="less-link2" href="#">Less</a>
</div>

<p id="less-text2"> When an event occurs, the provided function is executed. Inside the function, this refers to the element that was clicked. For details on jQuery events, visit the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/events/">Events documentation</a> on api.jquery.com.
