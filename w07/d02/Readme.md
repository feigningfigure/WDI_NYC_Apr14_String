## Homework

### An AJAX Status Ticker

"Polling" is a common design pattern in asynchronous software.

Polling is when one process constantly checks in with another process
to see if there are any updates available.

Everybody has at least one really annoying friend who practices this
pattern using text messages.

"Hey. What's up?"

"Yo. Anything cool going on?"

"Hey how you doing?"

Get polled!

#### Exercise Goal

Simulate the "cool factor" of a quiz app that tells every user
when a new quiz was created.

You can accomplish this with the following steps:

1. Open two browser tabs, both pointing to `http://localhost:4567/`
2. In Tab A, create a new quiz.
3. Switch to Tab B and verify that the page updated **even though
   you didn't do anything on Tab B**.

In other words, if your friend on Mars has their browser open on your
app, and you create a new quiz from your browser here on Earth, they
should see a change on their computer even though they're just chilling
out and looking at the page.
