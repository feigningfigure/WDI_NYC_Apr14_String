1. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

2. Keep track of your strategy as you solve this problem and write your code. For example: 

	- What language did you decide to work in first? Was the code you wrote in the first language useful when you rewrote your code in the second? Why and why not?
	
	- How did you break down the problem?
		
	- Did you use any resources other than your own brain?
	
	- When did you test?
	
	- Did you refactor your code?  If so, when: As you went along? After you had a solution that worked?  If not, why?
