### Multiples Monday


#### Okay, so if we were to...
list all the whole numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.


#### To do...

***In RUBY & JAVASCRIPT:***

1. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

2. Keep track of your strategy as you solve this problem and write your code. For example: 

	- What language did you decide to work in first? Was the code you wrote in the first language useful when you rewrote your code in the second? Why and why not?
	
	- How did you break down the problem?
		
	- Did you use any resources other than your own brain?
	
	- When did you test?
	
	- Did you refactor your code?  If so, when: As you went along? After you had a solution that worked?  If not, why?

## Homework


#### ATM application

- Keep track of checking and savings balances

DEPOSIT: As a user, I want to deposit money into one of my accounts
- Make sure you are updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page so a user can see the change.

WITHDRAWAL: As a user, I want to withdraw money from one of my accounts
- Make sure you are updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page so a user can see the change.
- Make sure the balance in an account can't go negative. 
- If a user tries to withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.
- When the balance of the bank account is $0, the background of that bank account should be red.
- It should be gray when there is money in the account.

OVERDRAFT PROTECTION: 
- What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking account than is in the account?
- These accounts have overdraft protection, so if a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the checking balance down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the savings account. If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignore the transaction.

- ***BONUS:***
- Read about Javascript's built in `alert` function.
- When an account tries to go negative, in addition to ignoring the transaction, use the `alert` function to notify the user that they do not have enough money in their account.
