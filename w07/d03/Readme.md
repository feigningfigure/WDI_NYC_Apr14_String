### Stopwatch


##### Starter files are in your personal folder

Create a stopwatch.  Watch the demo to see what your stopwatch should do.

- When the stopwatch starts, replace "Start the clock" with the time elapsed.
- When the stopwatch resets, replace the time elapsed with "Start the clock."

***TIPS:***
- Check out setInterval and clearInterval.
- 1000 ms = 1 second

## Homework

### Ajaxing Facebook


#### Specs

- Use Sinatra, Ajax, and the Facebook API (see: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api).
- This is a one-page app.

***NOTE: Do not make your Facebook API calls from within Ajax!***


#### User Stories

- The user can enter a person's name into a form on the page.

- After hitting "Find on Facebook", the user will see the following information returned from Facebook about the person: id, first and last name, gender, locale, and username.  (Do not make your Facebook API calls from within Ajax.)  This information will be displayed on the page.  It will also be added to a file.

- On the same page as the "Find on Facebook" form, the user can click a button or link and see a list of all the people they have found.


#### Bonus

- In the list of people found, make each person a link that when clicked returns the complete information on that person.
