### Homework

Create a Backbone application with 2 inter-related models: posts and comments.

In your application, you should be able to:

- create a post	
- create comments for that post

- edit posts
- delete posts

- edit comments
- delete comments 


How do we do this without a database?  Backbone has a method that allows us to use the browswer's cookies for local storage. For an example of how to do this, see:

http://backbonejs.org/docs/todos.html

Look for:

`localStorage: new Backbone.LocalStorage("todos-backbone")`

and read the code to understand how it's being implemented. To see a working example, go to:

http://localtodos.com/ 



#### Bonus:

- Build out your app with update capability for both posts and comments
