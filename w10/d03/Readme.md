### More REGEX

`Email regex is a hard problem.` But we're going to tackle it!


#### Before we write the REGEX...

`7-10 minutes`

We need a function to test whether or not our regex works.

So let's test whether or not a more simple regex is valid.

- Write a javascript function that returns `true` or `false` using a regex that tests for two words separated by a space.  (You can use the regex we made yesterday, with a few modifications.)


#### Create an email REGEX!

- Get into your Scrumr groups.

- I will count you off:  1, 2, 3

- Remember your number.

- Every five minutes, one person in your group will move clockwise to the next group. (Number 1s, then 2s, then 3s.)

- After 20 minutes, we'll test out our email attempts.
